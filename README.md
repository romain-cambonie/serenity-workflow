# Serenity Workflows

## About

Serenity workflows aim to provide easy to use, understand and modify reusable github actions workflows for common ci/cd use cases.

- Workflows DO NOT use marketplace actions or any dependencies except for github default actions.
- Workflows are given as local file for ease-of-modification and adaptation to your needs.

## Prerequisites

:warning: for a workflow to appear in your available workflows ({ YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL }/actions) a file with the same workflow name must be present on your default branch (usually master / main).

Workflow files contents are however branch dependent (so you can edit a workflow file and try it on a feature branch).


## Installation

- Copy the workflows files in your `.github/worflows` project folder.

- Commit / Push / Merge to your default (main / master) branch.

- Setup a deployer (Clevercloud / Scalingo ...)

- Fill the necessary env variables in a use case and run it.

## Utilisation

There are several types of workflow files :

### Setup
The setup files (*.setup.yml) are aimed to configure a deployer for the project.

They are run manually through the github action interface.

### Reusable workflows
The reusable workflows (.reusable.yml) are single responsibility building blocs that provide a service.
They are usually called by use-case workflows with inputs and may return several outputs

#### Available now:
##### Generic
- Cache dependencies using Yarn lockfile (nodes modules)
- Build application bundle
- Enumerate branches that follow a 'feature/*' name pattern
- Validation (run 'lint' and 'test' package.json scripts) 

##### Clevercloud specific
- Create/Deploy a node application
- Create/Deploy a static application
- Remove a deployed application

##### Deployment Notification hooks
- Discord
- Mattermost

### Use-Cases
Use-case workflows (*.use-case.yml) are used to provide complex scenarios.

They can be called by events (eg on branch push or merge) or event manually

#### Available as examples:
- Deploy an application on feature branch push (dep | build & validation | deploy | notify)
![dac_feature_branch_deploy.png](./docs/assets/dac_feature_branch_deploy.png)

- On feature branch deletion / merge delete the associated deployed application.
- Start the demo instances according to team schedule (uncomment the 'schedule' to activate the cron)
- Stop the demo instances according to team schedule (uncomment the 'schedule' to activate the cron)

### Available Deployers
#### Clevercloud

###### Prerequisites
- Have a clevercloud account
- Clevercloud workflows (files with the pattern *.clevercloud.*.yml) must be in your default branch .github/workflows folder.
